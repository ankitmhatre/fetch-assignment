# Recipe Fetching App 🍽️

This is an iOS recipe-fetching app built as an assignment for Fetch. The app fetches data from the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php), displaying a list of recipes for users to explore. Users can view detailed instructions, ingredients, and cooking methods for each recipe. This project was developed using **Swift** and **Xcode** and follows the **MVVM** architectural pattern for clean and maintainable code.

## Features
- 📋 **Recipe List:** The app displays a list of recipes fetched from the MealDB API.
- 🍲 **Detailed Recipe View:** Each recipe shows ingredients, instructions, and a high-quality image.
- 💻 **API Integration:** Data is fetched from the MealDB API and parsed asynchronously.
- 🏛️ **MVVM Architecture:** Ensures clear separation of concerns and scalable code.
- 🎨 **UI/UX:** A clean, responsive user interface using UIKit.
